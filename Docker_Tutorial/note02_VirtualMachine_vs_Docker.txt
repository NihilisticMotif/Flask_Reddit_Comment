Question: Virtual Machine vs Docker 

There are 3 layers in compuer
1. Hardware (CPU,RAM etc.)
2. OS Kernel
3. Software 

The OS Kernel is based on OS (operating system), and it is used for
make enable the software to interact with the hardware.

Virtual Machine virtualize OS Kernal and Software, which make the user to 
run different OS and Software in different computer and/or different platform.

On the other hands, Docker virtualize only software and utilize the OS Kernal of
the host, which make Docker faster and useless memory than Virtual Machine,
but the weakness of Docker is that it cannot be used with non-Linux (MacOS and Window) OS platform.

The good news is Docker Desktop (it use Hypervisor layer) can 
let's us run Docker with different OS system (including MacOS and Window).
